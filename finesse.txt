ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS
 functions :
--Its a random value within a range specified by the professor
--Enviormental parameters can be hard coded for each round by professor
--Environmental parameters can move along random paths with direction and speed (professor input )
--Environmental parameters can move basis other enviornmental parameters(system calculation)

Examples:
gdp
interest rate
inflation
share prices
crude prices
commodity prices




DECISION PARAMETERS:
functions:
--It takes enviornmental parameters as input
--Relationship with enviornmental parameters can be based  on one of many formulae to be decided by superadmin




AGENT CLASS:
funcionS:
--It should be able to self generate its entities based on inputs by admin and system calculation
--Each entity  can take certain decisions
--Decision parameters are input to decision making process.
--Player data is input to decision making process
--To take a decision an entity evaluates the decision parameters and player data.
--Decision making process depends on level of AI used
--It should be able to view decisions of all agents and give a aggregated data

Examples:
MEDIA
DEALERS--
VENDORS
CONSUMERS--
WORKERS--
SHAREHOLDERS
LENDERS
GOVERNMENT




Examples of decisions which agent can take:
--buy/sell
--index for each player in market
--probability of action
--cease/comes to existence
--efficiency/productivity
--affect enviornmental parameters


--->COMPANY:

SALES:
This will be calculated based on offtake  in the market which will be based on summation of players brand(s) sales across the consumer agents and price of the product(s)

PRODUCTION
--It will take input as quantity sold as decided by system
--Product_composition(prof_input) X Quantity_sold(system) X weight_per_unit(prof_input)=raw material consumption
--raw_material_cost=raw material consumption X raw_material_price(prof_input)
--raw_material_price is based on enviornmental parameters(admin_input)
--Inbound Logistics cost = raw_material_consumption X distance to relevant market(system) X freight cost(for all raw materials)
--Outbound logistics cost=Quantity_sold_per_market X freight cost X weight_per_unit X distance_to_relevant_market

EMPLOYEE_CATEGORY:
--Each category will have base salary,base_effect_on_sales,base_effect_on_quality_cost system generated(or prof_input)


EMPLOYEE:
--Each employee has a certian efficiency which when multiplied with base gives you final cost and effect .
--Employee efficiency depends on happiness quotient
--happiness quotient is a function of salary,category ,performance of the company(PROF AND SYSTEM),media index,avg_happiness_quotient in other competitors and  hr incentives(admin_input)
--Each employee has a cost that is salary +  quality cost(system)
--Salary is dependent on employee  efficiency and base salary


HRINCENTIVES:
--Each hr incentive has a certain cost  and certain base effect on employee
--It will be decided by professor


Employee HR Incentive effect:
--Each employee reacts differently to different HRINCENTIVES.


FACTORY:
--Each factory has certain number of employees per shift(SYSTEM)
--A factory can have 1/2/3 shifts decided by system
--It has certain distancâ€Že to each of the market as calculated by system
--It has a certain cost to build as calculated by system
--It has certain cost to run as calculated by system
--It has a certain capacity as calculated by system
--It has production per unit time as calculated by system



MARKET:
--It has a name
--It has catchment of dealers and/or catchment of vendors as calculated by system
--It should be able to create dealers and vendors as calculated by system
--It has proportions of consumer category as calculated by system



DEALER:
--Each dealer has a catchment of consumers as calculated by system and professor
--each dealer has a desired commission as calculated by system
--desired commission is a function of catchment
--each dealer has a category as calculated by system
--each dealer has a name
--each  dealer has a push index for each brand as calculated by system
--push index is a function of channel incentives(player),prefrence for channel incentives
--final commission per national dealer is a function of effect of sales of sales employees , brand power,desired commission,base commission , consumer catchment
--Each dealer has a consumer_catchment as calculated by system

--each consumer will take decision to buy/not buy a production
--purchase decision is a function of probability of purchase
--brand selection is a function of brand power, dealer push,price and personal taste
--Post purchase, a random toggle is generated which either increases or decreases personal taste for that brand
--probability of purchase is a function of category , decision parameters
--each consumer has media prefrences
--brand power is a funcion of media impact and media prefrences for each player
--Media prefrences is function of category
--if personal taste is 1 then the final brand which he chooses depends only upon his choice and if its 0, then brand power,dealer push and price comes into picture
